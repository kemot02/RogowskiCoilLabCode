# RogowskiCoilLabCode
This repository contains the prelab code and theoretical background for measuring alternating current using a Rogowski coil. The experiment focuses on analyzing sinusoidal AC current from the mains supply and calculating the induced voltage across the coil. Untitled.m is prelab code and Untitled2.m is the main work of the experiment.
